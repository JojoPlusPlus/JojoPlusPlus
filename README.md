I use C++ for most of my projects. That's were the name comes from. Very funny I know.

## Some things I like to do
- make games for old consoles, such as:
  - **Game Boy**
  - **WII**
  - **NDS**
- port small games made with **raylib** to those consoles
- develop games in general using **Unity**, **Unreal Engine** and other tools
- write small programs for own file formats, tools, or other fun stuff
- web development

## Cool technologies I like to use
- Raylib
- React
- Spring Boot
