# Jojo

I use `C++` for most of my projects. I also know a bit of `C#` and am learning `Rust`.

### Other things I like to do are
- making games for old consoles, such as:
  - **Gameboy**
  - **WII**
  - **NDS**
- porting small games made with **raylib** to those consoles
- developing games in general using **Unreal Engine** or **Unity**
- writing small programs for own file formats, tools, or other fun stuff

## Other technologies I use
- Raylib
- wxWidgets
- Java-/Typescript
- React (learning)
- Linux (Arch)
- CMake
